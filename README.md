## ‚ú® Features

This helper website aims to include:

*   **üìö Comprehensive Database:** Browse detailed, searchable information on core game elements:
    *   **Items:** Products (Marijuana strains, Meth variants, Cocaine), Ingredients & Additives, Equipment (Stations, Tools, Pots, Storage), Packaging, Seeds, Clothing, Vehicles, and other miscellaneous items.
    *   **Effects (Properties):** In-depth details on product effects, including tier, addictiveness, value modifiers, and the underlying mix vectors used in calculations.
    *   **NPCs:** Profiles for Customers (preferences, quality standards, affinities), Suppliers (inventory, contact methods), Employees (roles, skills, costs), Dealers (cut, capacity), Police mechanics, and key Story characters.
    *   **Locations:** Information on map Regions, purchasable Properties (bases, businesses), Stores, and Points of Interest (POIs).
    *   **Game Systems:** Data on Leveling (Ranks, Tiers, XP, Unlocks), Law Enforcement (Intensity, Curfew, Fines), Time progression, Economy rules, etc.

*   **üßÆ Calculators:** Tools to plan and optimize gameplay:
    *   **Mixing Calculator:** Estimate outcomes (effects, value, addictiveness) of mixing products with ingredients (*Note: Uses a simplified additive model; the game's Mixer Map system is more complex*).
    *   **Growing Calculator:** Calculate plant grow times, harvest dates, and watering schedules based on seed and pot types.
    *   **Leveling & Rank Calculator:** Determine current rank/tier from XP, calculate XP needed for next level, and view associated unlocks.
    *   **Casino Calculators:** Check Blackjack payouts and potential Ride the Bus (RTB) winnings.
    *   **Customer Satisfaction Calculator:** Estimate deal satisfaction and relationship changes based on product, quality, price, and effects.
    *   **Utility Cost Calculator:** Estimate daily/weekly power and water costs based on equipment usage.

*   **üìñ Guides (Planned/In Progress):**
    *   **Getting Started:** Step-by-step walkthrough for new players.
    *   **Game Mechanics:** Deep dives into Growing, Mixing, Economy, Law & Police, Employees, Deliveries, Combat, Time, etc.
    *   **Strategies:** Tips for optimization and profit maximization.

*   **üìù Tools & Planners (Uses Local Storage):** Manage your in-game operations:
    *   **Customer Tracker:** Log customer details, relationship levels, preferences, addiction, and deal cooldowns.
    *   **Delivery Tracker:** Manually track incoming supplier deliveries, contents, and estimated arrival times.
    *   **Financial Tracker:** Log cash/online transactions, manually update balances, and view transaction history.
    *   **Grow Planner:** Track individual plants, locations, pots, estimated harvest times, and watering needs.
    *   *(**Important:** Tool data is stored ONLY in your browser's `localStorage`. Clearing browser data will erase your tracked information.)*

*   **üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Map (Planned):** Visualize the game world, key locations, POIs, and potentially track dynamic events.

*   **üîç Search (Basic):** Basic search functionality across the database (implementation ongoing).

## üíª Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules)
*   **Data:** Game information is primarily extracted from game files and stored statically within the project (e.g., `database/game_data.js`). Accessed client-side.
*   **Persistence:** Tools & Planners use the browser's `localStorage` API for data storage. No server-side database is used for user data.
*   **Deployment:** (Specify if planned, e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)

*Rationale for Vanilla JS: Chosen for simplicity, performance, and ease of deployment without requiring complex build steps or frameworks.*

## üöÄ Project Status

This project is **under active development**.

*   **Functional:** Core database structure, data loading for many categories (Items, Effects, NPCs, Leveling), all Calculators, and the local storage-based Tools & Planners.
*   **In Progress:** Populating all database sections with complete data, refining calculator accuracy, implementing item/NPC detail template pages.
*   **Planned:** Detailed Guides section, Interactive Map integration, advanced Search functionality, potentially more tools.

Data accuracy depends on the game version the information was extracted from. Updates will be made as new information becomes available or the game changes.
